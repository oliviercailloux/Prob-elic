\section{Introduction}
Many studies have investigated the computational complexity of (variants of) sorting problems. The usual implicit hypothesis is that the number of objects to be sorted is large, and that we are mostly interested in order of magnitudes of number of comparisons required to achieve some desired state of knowledge, rather than exact number of comparisons.

This article focuses on a different use case: obtaining preference information from an individual over a small set of objects. We assume furthermore that determining her preference among objects of the set is cognitively difficult for the individual. For example, one may be interested in determining (part of) someone’s preferences over a set of political candidates; or some juror “preferences” over competitors in some contest.

This problem can be viewed as a variant of a sorting task, where the ordering relation is the one determined by the individual’s preference. Querying for her preference is akin to a comparison in a sorting task. In such a setting, however, contrary to the implicit hypothesis in sorting tasks, it is important to focus on precise bounds on the number of comparisons, not just asymptotic orders of magnitude. This is for two reasons. First, the set of objects should generally be supposed to be small. That is because individuals will not accept to answer hundreds of comparison questions. Furthermore, when such comparison questions is cognitively difficult, a gain of a constant factor in terms of number of comparisons is important.

An example of an application of the sorts of results we seek is in social choice. In social choice, one typically assumes that the voters preferences are known, and studies focus on merits of aggregation rules. However, in many cases, the preferences must be elicited. A typical case is the one of a recrutment committee. Our results aim at indicating how to obtain (partial) information about the preferences of the members of the committee over the set of candidates. This can then be used, for example, to compute necessary or possible winners.

\section{Set up and goal}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\allalts$ a set of objects. Example: $\allalts = {a, b, c}$.
	\item $n = |\allalts|$. Example: $n = 3$.
	\item $\linors$ the set of linear orders over $\allalts$, that is, of transitive and complete binary relations over $\allalts$ (a relation $\prefeq$ over $\allalts$ is complete iff $\forall i, j \in \allalts: i \pref j \lor j \pref i$).
	\item ${\prefeq} \in \linors$ a preference over $\allalts$. Example: $\set{(a, b), (a, c), (b, c)}$. Let $\pref$ be the irreflexive part of $\prefeq$, thus, ${\prefeq} = ({\pref} \cup {=})$.
	\item Let $\powerset{S}$ denote the set of subsets of $S$.
Let $P: \powerset{\linors} → [0, 1]$ denote a probability distribution over the possible preferences.
\end{itemize}
The preference $\prefeq$ is a priori unknown.
We only know the probability distribution over $\linors$, from which $\prefeq$ is drawn. 
We can ask questions to obtain information about $\prefeq$. 
We are interested in comparing questioning strategies and in evaluating the probabilistic evolution of our knowledge of $\prefeq$ as a function of the number of questions asked, for various strategies. 

\section{Questioning to increase our knowledge}
Let $\POs$ denote the set of partial orders over $\allalts$. A partial order ${\pprefeq} \subseteq \allalts × \allalts$ is a transitive, reflexive and antisymmetric relation.
It represents our knowledge of $\prefeq$.
Let $\ppref$ be the irreflexive part of $\pprefeq$, thus, ${\pprefeq} = ({\ppref} \cup {=})$.

Let $\pprefeq_t$ denote our knowledge after $t$ questions (or $\ppref_t$ for its irreflexive part).
Define ${\ppref_0} = \emptyset$ as our (empty) knowledge after zero questions.
Example of $\ppref_1 : \set{(a, b)}$.

A question $q \in Q$ is a non-oriented edge, which formally we consider as two edges, inverse of each other. Let $q_{ij} = \set{(i, j), (j, i)}$ denote the question about ${i, j}$, with $i ≠ j \in \allalts$.
Note that $q_{ij} = q_{ji}$.
The set of possible questions is $Q = \set{q_{ij} \suchthat i ≠ j \in \allalts}$.
It follows that $\card{Q} = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n (n - 1)}{2}$. In our running example, $\card{Q} = 3$.

Given $i ≠ j \in \allalts$, ${\pref} \cap q_{ij}$ is a singleton that contains the answer to the question $q_{ij}$ when the preference is $\pref$, that is, the edge connecting $i$ to $j$ that is in $\pref$.
Define an addition operation representing our increase in knowledge after having obtained an answer to a question: we add the resulting pair, and compute the transitive closure. Formally, given $\ppref$ and a question $q$, ${\ppref} + ({\pref} \cap q) = T({\ppref} \cup ({\pref} \cap q))$, where $T$ denotes the irreflexive transitive closure ($T(p) = \bigcup_{k \in N^*} p^k$). Example: $\set{(a, b)} + ({\pref} \cap q_{bc}) = {\pref}$.

Let ${\ppref^{±1}} = {\ppref} \cup {\ppref^{-1}}$ denote the set of pairs known in $\ppref$, thus, $q \subseteq {\ppref^{±1}}$ iff the answer to the question $q$ is known in $\ppref$.

%Let $K_\ppref = \set{\set{e, e^{-1}} \suchthat e \in {\ppref}} \subseteq Q$ denote the questions whose answer is known in $\ppref$. Note that $\card{K_\ppref} = \card{{\ppref}}$.
%Let $Q_\ppref = Q \setminus K_\ppref$ denote the questions remaining given $\ppref$. Note that $\card{Q_\ppref} = \card{Q} - \card{K_\ppref}$.
%Note that if we obtain at least one edge per step, then after $\card{Q}$ steps, our knowledge is complete: $Q_{\ppref_{\card{Q}}} = \emptyset$.

\subsection{Sequences of questions, of partial orders, and of digraphs}
Sequences of questions can be related to sequences of partial orders and to sequences of digraphs.
This section shows that if a sequence of partial orders corresponds to a sequence of questions, it corresponds to a unique sequence of questions.

Define the upper contour set of $x \in X$ as ${≥^{-1}}(x) = \set{y \in X \suchthat y ≥ x}$, thus, as the set of objects that are at least as good as $x$.
We first observe that a subset of an upper contour set that includes an object of which it is the upper contour set is the upper contour set of a unique object.
(A similar results holds for lower contour sets.)
\begin{proposition}[Folklore?]
	\label{th:ucs}
	Let $\set{x, y} \subseteq S \subseteq X$ such that $S \subseteq {≥^{-1}}(x)$ and $S \subseteq {≥^{-1}}(y)$. Then, $x = y$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	By hypothesis, $x \in S$, and $\forall s \in S: s ≥ y$. Thus, $x ≥ y$.
	By a symmetrical observation, $y ≥ x$.
	Because $>$ is asymmetric and ${≥} = {>} \cup {=}$, this implies $x = y$.
\end{proof}

Given ${\ppref}, {\ppref'} \in \POs$ and $i, j \in \allalts$, say that the question $q_{ij} \in Q$ may lead from $\ppref$ to $\ppref'$ iff ${\ppref'} = {\ppref} + (i, j) \lor{\ppref'} = {\ppref} + (j, i)$.

Given ${\ppref}, {\ppref'} \in \POs$, say that the transition from $\ppref$ to $\ppref'$ is legal iff some question may lead from $\ppref$ to $\ppref'$.
Given $k \in \N$, let $\intvl{1, k}$ denote the interval of integers between $1$ and $k$.
Say that a sequence of partial orders $(\ppref_t) \in \POs^k$ is legal iff the transition from $\ppref_t$ to $\ppref_{t + 1}$ is legal $\forall t \in \intvl{1, k - 1}$.

Any legal sequence of partial orders defines uniquely a corresponding sequence of questions. The following proposition shows that any two adjacent partial orders in a legal sequence together define uniquely the left member of the answer that was added. As a similar result holds, by symmetry, for the right member, this proves the point.
\begin{proposition}
	Given ${\ppref}, {\ppref'} \in \POs$ and $i, j \in X$ such that ${\ppref'} = {\ppref} + (i, j)$, $i$ is determined uniquely by ${\ppref}$ and ${\ppref'}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $N = {\ppref'} \setminus {\ppref}$ be the set of pairs brought thanks to the answer $(i, j)$. Suffices to prove that $N$ determine $i$ uniquely. 
	
	Consider $M = (N \cup {=})$, the reflexive relation equivalent to $N$.
	By definition of $+$, $M \subseteq \set{(i', j') \suchthat i' ≥ i \land j ≥ j'}$. 
	Let $L = M^{-1}(\allalts)$ be the left projection of $M$. 
	We see that $L$ includes $i$ and is a subset of the upper contour set of $i$. 
	\Cref{th:ucs} thus concludes.
\end{proof}

We can also think of $\ppref$ as a directed graph, or digraph, whose set of nodes is $\allalts$. We thus define a bijection that relates $\ppref$ to $G = (\allalts, \ppref)$, its corresponding digraph, and talk interchangeably about a digraph or a set of edges or a partial order. This bijection defines the possible digraphs: those having nodes $\allalts$ and a transitive and acyclic set of edges.

\section{Questioning strategies and probability distributions}
Given a partial order $\ppref$, we write $P(\ppref) = P(\set{{\pref} \in \linors \suchthat {\ppref} \subseteq {\pref}})$ for the probability that the real preference be compatible with $\ppref$.

Define a questioning strategy as a function $s: \POs \setminus \linors → [0, 1]^Q$ that given a current knowledge state ${\ppref} \in \POs \setminus \linors$ returns a probability distribution over the set of possible questions $Q$. 

The probability distribution $P$ over the possible preferences and a strategy $s$ determine in a natural way several probability distributions. 

Given ${\pref} \in \linors$ and a sequence of questions $(q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} \in Q^k$ of length $k \in \N^*$, define the corresponding sequence of partial orders $({\ppref}_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} \in \POs^k$ as ${\ppref_0} = \emptyset$ and ${\ppref_t} = {\ppref_{t - 1}} + ({\pref} \cap q_t) = T(\cup_{q \in \set{q_1, …, q_t}} ({\pref} \cap q))$.
Note that if the relation was not complete at step $k - 1$, it also was incomplete before: ${\ppref_{k - 1}} \notin \linors ⇒ \forall t \in \intvl{1, k - 1}: {\ppref_t} \notin \linors$. 

Given ${\prefeq} \in \linors$, define $Q^{\prefeq} = \cup_{k \in \N^*} \set{(q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} \in Q^k \suchthat {\ppref_{k - 1}} \notin \linors \land {\ppref_k} \in \linors}$ as the set of finite sequences of questions that lead to a linear order just after the last question and not before. 

Given ${\prefeq} \in \linors$, $k \in \N^*$ and $(q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} \in Q^{\prefeq}$, define $P^{\prime s}(\prefeq, (q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}})$ as the probability of ${\prefeq} \in \linors$ being the real preference and of the strategy $s$ asking the sequence of questions $(q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}}$ as: 
\begin{equation}
	P^{\prime s}(\prefeq, (q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}}) = 
	P(\prefeq)  \prod_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} s(\ppref_{t - 1})(q_t).
\end{equation}

For example, $P^{\prime s}(\prefeq, q_1, q_2, q_3)$ denotes the probability that the preference is $\prefeq$ and that the questions, chosen according to the strategy $s$, were $q_1$, then $q_2$, and finally $q_3$.

Given ${\prefeq} \in \linors$, $k \in \N^*$ and $(q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} \in Q^k$, let $P^{\prime s}(\prefeq, (q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}})$ denote $P^{\prime s}(\prefeq, \set{(q'_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k'}} \in Q^{\prefeq} \suchthat k' ≥ k \land \restr{q'_t}{\intvl{1, k}} = q_t})$, the probability that the real preference be $\prefeq$ and that the strategy $s$ asks any sequence of questions in $Q^{\prefeq}$ that completes $q_t$.

Given $k \in \N^*$, ${\prefeq} \in \linors$ and $(q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} \in Q^k$ such that ${\ppref}_{k - 1} \notin \linors$, define $P^s(\prefeq, (q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}})$ as the probability of ${\prefeq} \in \linors$ being the real preference and of the strategy $s$ asking the sequence of questions $(q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}}$ as: 
\begin{equation}
	P^s(\prefeq, (q_t)_{t \in \intvl{1, k}}) = 
	P(\prefeq)  \prod_{t \in \intvl{1, k}} s(\ppref_{t - 1})(q_t).
\end{equation}

\begin{proposition}
	$P^s = P^{\prime s}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	This follows from the corresponding definitions.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	We can view $s$ as the conditional probabilities given by $P^s$, as these examples show for the cases of one and two questions (which can be generalized naturally).
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P^s(q_1 | >_c) = P^s(>_c, q_1) / P^s(>_c) = P^s(>_c) s(\emptyset)(q_1) / P(>_c) = s(\emptyset)(q_1)$.
		\item $P^s(q_2 | >_c, q_1) = P^s(>_c, q_1, q_2) / P^s(>_c, q_1) = P^s(>_c, q_1, q_2) / [s(\emptyset)(q_1)P(>_c)] = s(\emptyset)(q_1) s(>_1)(q_2) / s(\emptyset)(q_1) = s(>_1)(q_2).$
	\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

As the sequence of questions determines the sequence of partial orders, we can also consider $P^s$ as a probability distribution over (parts of) sequences of partial orders. 
Example: $P^s({\ppref_1} = \set{(a, b)}) = P^s(q_1 = q_{ab} \land a \pref b)$.
Example: $P^s({\ppref_2} = \set{(a, b), (c, b)}) = P^s\big(\set{q_1, q_2} = \set{q_{ab}, q_{bc}} \land a \pref b \land c \pref b\big)$.

Define $P^\mathit{eq}$ as the equiprobable distribution over $\linors$, thus, $\forall {\pref} \in \linors: P^\mathit{eq}(\pref) = 1/\card{\linors}$.

Given $i, j \in \allalts$, $k \in \N$, let $P^s(i \ppref_k j) = P^s((i, j) \in {\ppref_k})$ denote the probability that the edge $(i, j)$ be known after $k$ questions. (Under reasonable conditions of symmetry on $P$ and $s$, this will be half of $P^s(q_{ij} \subseteq {\ppref^{±1}_k})$, the probability that the answer to the question $q_{ij}$ be known after $k$ questions.)

Can we obtain a nice formula for $P^s(i \ppref_k j)$?

\subsection{Random questions without repetition}
The random strategy without repetition $s^\mathit{rm}$ draws a question equiprobably from the set of remaining questions. Thus, $\forall {\ppref} \in \POs \setminus \linors, i ≠ j \in \allalts$:
\begin{equation}
	s^\mathit{rm}(\ppref)(q_{ij}) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{1}{\card{(X^2 \setminus {\pprefeq}^{±1})} / 2} & \text{ if } q_{ij} \nsubseteq {\ppref^{±1}},\\
		0 & \text{ if } q_{ij} \subseteq {\ppref^{±1}},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\card{(X^2 \setminus {\pprefeq}^{±1})} / 2$ represents the number of questions remaining when knowing $\ppref$.

\subsection{Questioning by sorting a subset of objects}
Given a budget of $k$ questions, we can adopt the following questioning strategy. Fix $l$ objects such that they can be sorted by asking at most $k$ questions (thus $l$ greater than order of $\frac{k}{\log k}$?). Ask questions so as to sort them. We obtain $\card{{\ppref}} = \binom{l}{2}$.
Thus, perhaps, $\card{{\ppref}}$ is order of $\binom{k / \log k}{2}$.
TODO: be more precise.

\subsection{Median strategy}
(Thanks to Michail.)
Given a budget of $k$ questions, we can adopt the following questioning strategy. 
Fix $l$ objects.
Ask questions so as to: 1) determine their median in $\pref$ (“this can be done with O(l) comparisons deterministically”) and 2) partition the subset of $l$ objects among $\frac{l}{2}$ objects preferred to the median and $\frac{l}{2}$ other ones.
We obtain $\card{{\ppref}} = \frac{l^2}{4}$.
Thus, $\card{{\ppref}}$ order of $\frac{k^ 2}{4}$.
TODO: be more precise. See \hrefblue{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians\#Proof_of_O(n)_running_time}{Median of medians}; Knuth, Sorting and Searching, vol. 3; Cormen, Intro to algorithms…

Here is an algorithm to select a median of $n$ elements, with worst case complexity $O(n^2)$ and average complexity $O(n)$ (the lower or the upper median are both acceptable results).
Select a pivot element randomly (equiprobably). Compare the $n - 1$ other elements to the pivot. Run again on either the lower elements or the higher elements, depending on where the median lies, or stop if a median has been found. 

Let $V_[m_1, m_2](n)$ be the number of comparisons required to find the $m_1$th or $m_2$th element among $n$, $V_m(n)$ for $V_[m, m](n)$, $V(n)$ for $V_[\floor{\frac{n}{2}}](n)$, and let us compute an upper bound for $E[V(n)]$.
Because of our equiprobable pivot draw, we have $1/n$ chances to pick a pivot that will turn out the be the $k$ th element (in order). Assume, pessimistically, that we always recurse on the biggest partition. If we picked a pivot that is the first or last element (that happens with odds $2/n$), we recurse on a partition of size $n - 1$. And so on (if $n$ is odd, one of the terms appears only once instead of twice). We obtain $E[V(n)] ≤ \frac{2}{n} \sum_{k = \floor{n/2}}^{n - 1} E[V(k)] + (n - 1)$.

A classical result is that $E[V(n)] \in O(n)$ [Cormen et al.].

That bound is tight for $1 ≤ n ≤ 2$, as $V(1) = 0$ and $V(2) = 1$. Also, $E[V(3)] = 2 + \frac{2}{3}$ and $E[V(4)] = 3 + \frac{1}{2}E[V(3, [1, 2])] = 4 + \frac{1}{3}$.

\section{The equiprobable distribution}
Here we consider $P = P^\mathit{eq}$. 

\subsection{Some probabilities}
\begin{proposition}
	Consider any $X' \subseteq X$ and any ${\ppref} \in \linors[X']$. $P(\ppref) = 1 / (\card{X'})!$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider any ${\ppref}, {\ppref'} \in \linors[X']$. We have that $P(\ppref) = P(\ppref')$.
	We also know that the set of all possible linear orderings over $X'$ represents a sure event, thus, $P(\linors[X']) = 1$, and that $\ppref$ and $\ppref'$ are disjoint events. 
	Thus, $\sum_{{\ppref} \in \linors[X']} P(\ppref) = 1$.
	The result follows.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
	Consider any $X' \subseteq X$ and any partial order $\ppref$ over $X'$. Its probability $P(\ppref)$ is independent of $n$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	$P(\ppref) = \sum_{{\ppref'} \in \linors[X'] \suchthat {\ppref} \subseteq {\ppref'}} P(\ppref') = x / (\card{X'})!$, where $x$ is the number of linear orderings over $X'$ that extend $\ppref'$. This quantity does not depend on $n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[draft!]
	\label{th:indep}
	Given $X' \subseteq X$, ${\ppref} \in \POs[X']$ with a single connected component containing only incomparable elements better than $b$ and incomparable elements below $b$, and $a, b \in X$ such that $q_{ab} \cap {\ppref} = \emptyset$: 
	\[P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}) = \frac{1 + {\ppref}(b)}{1 + {\ppref}(b) + 1 + {\ppref}^{-1}(b)}.\]
	In particular, it is independent of the relative ordering of the elements below $b$.
	\footnote{This is also equal to:
		\[P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}) = \frac{(1 + {\ppref}(b))! {\ppref}^{-1}(b)!}{(1 + {\ppref}(b))! {\ppref}^{-1}(b)! + {\ppref}(b)! (1 + {\ppref}^{-1}(b))!}.\] 
	}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Assume some set $E \subseteq \powerset{\linors}$ is such that $\cup E$ is a sure event and for any two elements $e, e' \in E$: $\set{{\ppref'} \subseteq {\ppref} \suchthat a \ppref' b, {\ppref'} \in e}$ is in bijection with $\set{{\ppref'} \subseteq {\ppref} \suchthat a \ppref' b, {\ppref'} \in e'}$, and $\set{{\ppref'} \subseteq {\ppref} \suchthat {\ppref'} \in e}$ is in bijection with $\set{{\ppref'} \subseteq {\ppref} \suchthat {\ppref'} \in e'}$. It follows that $P(e \knowing {\ppref}) = P(e' \knowing {\ppref})$ and that $P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}, e) = P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}, e')$.
	
	Thus:
	$P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}) = \sum_{e \in E} P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}, e) P(e \knowing \ppref)$, 
	and with any $e \in E$: 
	$P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}) = \card{E} P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}, e) \frac{1}{\card{E}} = P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}, e)$.
	
	This shows that we can fix (as $e$) the relative ordering of the elements above $b$, and of the elements below $b$.
	The result now follows from $P(a > b \knowing {\ppref}) = \frac{P(a > b, {\ppref}, e)}{P({\ppref}, e)} = \frac{P(a > b, {\ppref}, e)}{P(a > b, {\ppref}, e) + P(b > a, {\ppref}, e)}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Should we always exploit the median?}
We might attempt to answer analytically the following question: should we always ask $b$ VS everything else when we know a chain $abc$? Thus, when $\prefeq$ includes $abc$, and $q_{be}$, $q_{bf}$, … has been answered, should we ask $q_{bg}$? (That’s what every optimal strategy that we found do.) It’s a bit strange that it seems not optimal to systematically strive for a chain of three (see $k = 5$).

\begin{conjecture}
Assume $>$ has a single connected component, and the maximal size of a chain is 3. Assume $b$ is the middle element of every chain of size 3. Then the optimal strategy asks $b$ with a new element.
\end{conjecture}
I’d say this is probably true but difficult to prove because of the complicated shapes such as ${abc, be, dc}$. Let’s start with something simpler.

\begin{conjecture}
Assume > has a single connected component, and every undirected path has at most three objects. Assume $b$ is the middle element of every chain of size 3, and some element $f$ is not part of the component. Then asking $q_{bf}$ is an optimal strategy.
\end{conjecture}
\begin{proof}
	Let’s check first that this is myopically optimal. Consider a chain $abc$.
	\[E[\card{T({>} \cup (\pref \cap q_{af}))} - \card{{>}} - 1 \knowing >] = P(f > a \knowing >) ({>}(b) + 1),\]
	\[E[\card{T({>} \cup (\pref \cap q_{bf}))} - \card{{>}} - 1 \knowing >] = P(f > b \knowing >) {>}(b) + P(b > f \knowing >) {>}^{-1}(b).\]
	Thus, we need to prove:
	\[P(f > b \knowing >) >(b) + P(b > f \knowing >) {>}^{-1}(b) > P(f > a \knowing >) {>}(b) + P(f > a \knowing >),\]
	or equivalently:
	\[[P(f > b \knowing >) - P(f > a \knowing >)] {>}(b) > P(f > a \knowing >) + P(f > b \knowing >) {>}^{-1}(b) − {>}^{-1}(b).\]
	
	We know that $P(f > b \knowing >) > P(f > a \knowing >)$, because the event $f > b$ includes the event $f > a$ and the probability of the difference is not null.
	
	I suspect that this is true even when replacing ${>}^{-1}(b)$ with 1, a proof of which would suffice to prove the claim (because this replacement is unfavorable to $E[q_{bf}]$). Because $P(f > a \knowing >) + P(f > b \knowing >) − 1 < 2 P(f > b \knowing >) − 1$, we would thus have to prove:
	\[[P(a > f > b \knowing >)] {>}(b) ≥ 2 P(f > b \knowing >) − 1.\]
	
	Perhaps this can be done using \cref{th:indep}…
\end{proof}

\subsection{Optimal strategies for 3 questions}
Consider $n ≥ 4$ and let us determine the strategies that maximize the expected number of edges known after $3$ questions, thus, $E^s[\card{{\ppref}_3}]$.

We write $cd$ instead of $\set{(c, d)}$, $abc$ instead of $\set{(a, b), (b, c), (a, c)}$, and so on.

The following computations (assuming $P = P^\text{eq}$ and independent of $s$) show that there are two tied optimal strategies (plus the obvious symmetries). One optimal strategy, after $q_{ab}$, asks about $q_{cd}$, then joins the two disconnected components by asking about the top ones of each component; and the other one, after $q_{ab}$, asks about $q_{bc}$, then, if obtaining a linear order over $\set{a, b, c}$, asks about the median one and $d$, and otherwise, asks about the one connected to the two other ones and $d$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $E[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_2} - 1 \knowing {\ppref}_2 = abc, q_3 = q_{cd}] = 1/2$. {\tiny $P(cd \knowing abc) = \frac{P(abcd)}{P(abc)} = \frac{3!}{4!} = 1/4$. Edges gained if $cd$: 2. Otherwise: 0.}
	\item $E[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_2} - 1 \knowing {\ppref}_2 = abc, q_3 = \bm{q_{bd}}] = 1$.
	\item $E[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_2} - 1 \knowing {\ppref}_2 = \set{ab, cb}, q_3 = \bm{q_{bd}}] = 1/2$. {\tiny $P(bd \knowing ab, cb) = P(ac \knowing ab, cb) P(bd \knowing acb) + P(ca \knowing ab, cb) P(bd \knowing cab) = 1/2 P(bd \knowing acb) + 1/2 P(bd \knowing cab) = 1/4$. Gain: $2$. Otherwise, gain: $0$.}
	\item $E[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_2} - 1 \knowing {\ppref}_2 = \set{ab, cb}, q_3 = q_{da}] = 3/8$. {\tiny $P(da \knowing ab, cb) = 1/2 P(da \knowing acb) + 1/2 P(da \knowing cab) = 1/2 P(dacb \knowing acb) + 1/2 P(dab, cab \knowing cab) = 1/2 (1/4) + 1/2 (2/4) = 3/8$. Gain if $da$: $1$. Otherwise: $0$.}
	\item $E[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_2} - 1 \knowing {\ppref}_2 = \set{ab, cb}, q_3 = q_{ac}] = 0$.
	\item $E[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_2} - 1 \knowing {\ppref}_2 = \set{ab, cd}, q_3 = q_{da}] = 1/2$. {\tiny $P(da \knowing ab, cd) = P(cdab \knowing ab, cd) = \frac{4}{4!} = 1/6$. Gain if $da$: $3$. Otherwise: $0$.}
	\item $E[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_2} - 1 \knowing {\ppref}_2 = \set{ab, cd}, q_3 = \bm{q_{ac}}] = 1$.
	\item $E^s[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_1} - 2 \knowing {\ppref}_1 = ab, q_2 = \bm{q_{cd}}] = 1$.
	\item $E^s[\card{{\ppref}_3} - \card{{\ppref}_1} - 2 \knowing {\ppref}_1 = ab, q_2 = \bm{q_{bc}}] = 1$. {\tiny $P(bc \knowing ab) = \frac{2!}{3!} = 1/3$. Immediate gain if $bc$: $1$. $E$ total gain if $bc$: $2$. Otherwise, immediate gain is $0$ and total gain is $1/2$. Thus, $E$ total gain: $1/3 × 2 + 2/3 × 1/2 = 1$.}
\end{itemize}

See \cref{fig:k3a,fig:k3b}.

\subsection{Optimum for 4 questions}
Computer experiments show that the following is the strategy that maximizes $E^s[\card{{\ppref}_4}]$ (assuming $n ≥ 5$). 
Start by using two questions to order $\set{a, b, c}$. If $>_2$ is a linear order (say, $abc$), spend the remaining two questions by comparing yet unknown elements with $b$. Otherwise (say, $\set{a, c} > b$), disconnect temporarily by asking $q_{de}$ (say, $de$), then connect the two components by asking $q_{be}$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Optimum for 5 questions}
Computer experiments show that the following is the strategy that maximizes $E^s[\card{{\ppref}_5}]$ (assuming $n ≥ 6$). 
Start by using two questions to order $\set{a, b, c}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Assume that $>_2$ is a linear order (say, $abc$). Then ask $q_{bd}$, $q_{be}$ and $q_{bf}$.
	\item Say, ${>_2} = \set{a, c} > b$. Then two optimal strategies follow.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Disconnect temporarily by asking $q_{de}$ (say, $de$), then connect the two components by asking $q_{be}$. If $b > e$ then we obtain $>_4 = \set{a, c} > b > e, d > e$. We can exploit the chain of three elements and end up with $q_{bf}$. Otherwise, $eb$, we obtain ${>_4} = \set{a, c} > b, d > e > b$. We can exploit the chain of three elements and end up with $q_{ef}$. 
		\item Ask $bd$. If ${>_3} = \set{a, c, d} > b$, disconnect; say $ef$, then $q_{bf}$. Otherwise, ${>_3} = \set{a, c} > b > d$, and ask $q_{be}$ then $q_{bf}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimum for 6 questions}
Computer experiments show that the following is the strategy that maximizes $E^s[\card{{\ppref}_6}]$ (assuming $n ≥ 7$). 
Start by using two questions to order $\set{a, b, c}$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Assume that $>_2$ is a linear order (say, $abc$). Then ask $q_{bd}$, $q_{be}$, $q_{bf}$ and $q_{bg}$.
	\item Say, ${>_2} = \set{a, c} > b$. Then $q_{ac}$. Say, wlog: ${>_3} = acb$. Then ask $q_{cd}$, $q_{ce}$ and $q_{cf}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The random strategy}
Here we consider $P = P^\mathit{eq}$ and $s$ the random strategy without repetition. 
We write $P$ instead of $P^s$.
\commentOC{We shouldn’t do that. We should rewrite this section to follow new notations and clarify (and continue)…}

When $\card{{\ppref_1}} = 1$, $P(\ppref_1) = \frac{1}{\card{Q}} \frac{1}{2}$.

Note that $P(\card{{\ppref_1}} = 1) = 1$, thus, $P(\ppref_2) = P(\ppref_2 \knowing \card{{\ppref_1}} = 1)$.

Let’s now evaluate $P(\ppref_2 \knowing \card{{\ppref_2}} = 2)$.
We may pick a question one end of which we know something about. There’s $2 (n - 2)$ such questions ($n - 2$ for each object in $\ppref_1$). If so, we need the answer to be oriented in a certain way to prevent transitive closure to bring anything new. Otherwise, we may pick a question whose two ends are yet unknown. There’s $n - 2$ choose $2$ such questions. Indeed, in total, there remains $2 (n - 2) + \frac{(n - 2) (n - 3)}{2} = \frac{(n - 2) (n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n (n - 1)}{2} - 1$ questions given $\ppref_1$.
Thus, $P(\ppref_2 \knowing \card{{\ppref_2}} = 2) = \frac{n - 1}{n + 1}$
(by noticing that $\card{Q_{\ppref_2}} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}-1=\frac{(n-2)(n+1)}{2}$).

And $P(\ppref_2 \knowing \card{{\ppref_2}} = 3) = 2 \frac{2 (n - 2) 1/2}{(n - 2) (n + 1)} = \frac{2}{n + 1}$.

\section{Best possible number of edges}
Assume we are the luckiest possible: we can choose the orientation of edges (the answers to questions) so as to maximise the number of resulting edges.

Define the \emph{original graph} as the graph $G$ containing the edge $(a, b)$ iff the question $a \relq b$ was asked and answered with $a > b$. Consider $k < n$. After $k$ questions, $G$ has $k$ edges at best.
The following proposition shows that to maximise the number of edges, it is necessary and sufficient to choose any $k + 1$ vertices and connect them. Note that any graph $G$ with $k$ edges can be uniquely decomposed into components having $k_1$, $k_2$, … edges, with $\sum_i k_i = k$ (in a component, there is a non-oriented path linking any two vertices of the component, and any two components are disconnected).
\begin{proposition}
	Let $G = (\allalts, E)$ be an oriented acyclic graph (not necessarily closed transitively) composed of components having $k_1$, $k_2$, … edges, with $\sum_i k_i = k$.
	Then, its transitive closure $T_G$ has $\binom{k + 1}{2}$ edges iff there is only one component having $k$ edges; otherwise, $T_G$ has less than $\binom{k + 1}{2}$ edges.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Folklore?]
	In general, $T_G$ has at most $\sum_i \binom{k_i + 1}{2}$ edges. The claim holds because $\binom{k + 1}{2} ≥ \sum_i \binom{k_i + 1}{2}$, with equality iff there is only one component.
	Indeed, the left hand side is half of $(k + 1) k = (\sum_i k_i + 1) \sum_i k_i = (\sum_i k_i)^2 + \sum_i k_i ≥ \sum_i k_i^2 + \sum_i k_i$, with equality iff there is only one component; whereas the right hand side is half of $\sum_i (k_i + 1) k_i = \sum_i k_i^2 + \sum_i k_i$.
\end{proof}

Idea: if I have two components, I must not attach to any of them a $k+2$nd element, otherwise, I have no hope of joining the components.

Idea2: Hyp, optimal strategies with $k-1$ questions or less are all connex. Prove that opt str with $k$ questions is connex. I know that $E^k > E^{k - 1} + 1$, where $E^k$ is the expected nm of edges with opt strat.

\section{Example context}
$N$ the voters (reviewers), $\card{N} = n$; $X$ the items (articles submitted to a conference), $\card{X} = m$. $PO(X)$ the partially ordered sets over $X$. Let $Q \in PO(X)^N$ represent some partial knowledge of the voters preferences. Consider $f: PO(X)^N → \powersetz{X}$ an enlarged voting rule, that selects winning items on the basis of partial knowledge of the preferences of the voters. Define $f(Q) = \min_{x \in X} \max_{y \in X, (>_{i \in N}) \in compl(Q)} s(y, (>_{i \in N})) - s(x, (>_{i \in N}))$ as selecting the alternatives that minimize the worst regret, where $s$ is the Borda scoring rule (attributing to an alternative at a profile as many points as that alternative beats other alternatives, summed over all voters).

We are interested in asking questions so as to let the regret diminish as fast as possible.
